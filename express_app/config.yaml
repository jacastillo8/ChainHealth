# Services is where you define the participating organizations in the blockchain. The application supports two main roles.
#   1) Healthcare: This is the typical medical professional role. Users in this role will be the ones inserting
#      transactions and also will feel the benefits of blockchain's data integrity feature, more visually.
#   2) Auditor: This role is used to interact with the data stored in the blockchain. Queries and performance analysis 
#      are the features of this power user. Auditors can create cross-platform datasets from the blockchain to assess the 
#      progress of the patients or to improve medical research.
